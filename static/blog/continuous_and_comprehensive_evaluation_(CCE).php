                     <h3>Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation <strong>(CCE)</strong></h3>
                      
                     <p>Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) system was introduced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in India to assess all aspects of a student's development on a continuous basis throughout the year. The assessment covers both scholastic subjects as well as co-scholastic areas such as performance in sports, art, music, dance, drama, and other cultural activities and social qualities.</p>
                     
                    <h4>Evaluation of Scholastic Areas</h4>
                    <p>Scholastic subjects are assessed using two modes: Formative Assessment (FA) and Summative Assessment (SA). Formative Assessment usually comprises of Class Tests, Homework, Quizzes, Projects, and Assignments directed throughout the year. Summative Assessment measures how much a student has learnt from the class through an examination/test conducted at the end of a term.                    </p>

                    <p> Total:  Formative Assessments (FA) = FA1+FA2+ FA3+FA4 = 40%<br />
Summative Assessments (SA) = SA1+SA2 = 60%<br />
Scholastic Assessment grades are generally given on a 9 point grading scale.
</p>
                     <p><strong>Evaluation of Co-Scholastic Areas</strong><strong> </strong><br>
                        Co-Scholastic areas are  assessed using multiple techniques on the basis of specific criteria.  Assessment of co-scholastic areas is done at the end of the year, and grades  are generally given on a 5 point grading scale. </p>
                     <p><br>
                       <strong>Thumbs Up</strong><br>
                       One of the growth  aspects of the CCE system is that it aims to help reduce stress in students  because they work alongside the students individually and guide them depending  on their specific strengths and ability. Employing a variety of remedial  measures of teaching based on learning needs and potential of different  students. They also pride themselves on encouraging students to excel in areas  that they are stronger in.</p>
                      <p>    The CCE system  also focuses on holistic education which aims to develop various aspects of a  student's personality which ultimately helps them identify what they are better  at and stronger at in terms of academics. Holistic education demands  development of all aspects of individual’s personality including cognitive,  affective and psycho motor domains.</p>
                      <p>With CCE  aiming at all round development of the child’s personality it is expected that  a student will be able to take up competitive examinations in right earnest.  They aim to make the students feel more relaxed so they improve on their  academic ability without feeling under pressure.<br>
                        <u>Grading:</u><br>
                        A1 is for 9.1-10.0, A2 is for 8.1-9.0, B1 is for 7.1-8.0, B2  is for 6.1-7.0, C1 is for5.1-6.0, C2 is for 4.1-5.0, D is for 3.1-4.0,<br>
                    E1 is for 2.1-3.0, E2 is for1.1-2.0.               </p>
                      <p><strong>Thumbs Down</strong></p>
                    <p>It's  main Disadvantages is that &quot;grading system&quot; because for example  students that score between 90 and 100 will get an A* grade. Who is scoring 90  marks and 99 marks respectively will still both attain an A* No one can Judge  who is deserve 90 who is deserve 100.</p>
                      <p>Despite the system  aiming to lessen stress, the grading system may in fact cause more stress for  the students. For example, a student may feel more pressure to get a higher  grade because the grade margin is substantially larger than you would expect.</p>
                      <p>Assessment  and other co curriculum activities is too much time consuming and expensive  assignments and projects.<br>
                        <br>
                        Students  are forced to study all-round the year, which in a way, is like giving no rest  to them. Each and every activity is monitored constantly.<br>
                        <br>
                        Even though CCE is a radical concept in the reformation of  education system in India, but the disadvantages need to be addressed in a  right manner so as to bring about a real, genuine and positive transformation  to the education patterns with reduced stress over students.</p>
